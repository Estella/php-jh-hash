JH hash function for PHP 
Version 0.1

JH is a hash function which was submitted to the NIST hash competition
(2008--2012) in October 2008 and selected as one of the five finalists. There
are four JH hash algorithms, namely, JH-224, JH-256, JH-384 and JH-512,
constructed from the same compression function. 

The author of this extension was in no way involved in the development of the
Gr√∏stl hash function. The hash source code was taken directly from NIST
submission package with a few minor variable name changes so that it would play
nice with PHP.

See the CREDITS section for more details.

The SHA-3 Submission Requirements states:

   "Each submitted algorithm must be available worldwide on a royalty free
   basis during the period of the hash function competition."

If the algorithm is selected as the winner of the competition, the following
applies: 

   "an irrevocable nonexclusive royalty-free license to practice the referenced
   algorithm, reference implementation or the optimized implementations"

If the algorithm is not selected as the winner, the license will be determined
