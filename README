JH hash function for PHP 
Version 0.1

JH is a hash function submitted to the NIST hash competition (2008--2012) in
October 2008. There are four JH hash algorithms, namely, JH-224, JH-256, JH-384
and JH-512, constructed from the same compression function. In January 2011,
the round number of JH is changed from 35.5 to 42 for better hardware
efficiency and larger security margin. 

The author of this extension was in no way involved in the development of the
Gr√∏stl hash function. The hash source code was taken directly from NIST
submission package with a few minor variable name changes so that it would play
nice with PHP.

=== Installation ===

You'll need to have the PHP 5 development package and a working build
environment to compile this module.

To compile and install:

phpize
./configure --enable-jh
make
sudo make install

Then add the following to your php.ini file:

extension=jh.so

=== Usage ===

Function Description:
   
   string jh_hash(string $string [, int bit_length = 512])

Example:

   // Build a base-64 encoded hash
   $hash = base64_encode(jh_hash('Hello, world.'));

=== License ===

The SHA-3 Submission Requirements states:

   "Each submitted algorithm must be available worldwide on a royalty free
   basis during the period of the hash function competition."

If the algorithm is selected as the winner of the competition, the following
applies: 

   "an irrevocable nonexclusive royalty-free license to practice the referenced
   algorithm, reference implementation or the optimized implementations"

If the algorithm is not selected as the winner, the license will be determined
by the team.
